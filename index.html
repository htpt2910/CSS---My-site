        <p class="p2">Whither away so early, Little Red Riding Hood?"

            "To my grandmother's."
            
            "What have you got in your apron?"
            
            "Cake and wine. Yesterday was baking-day, so poor sick grandmother is to have something good, to make her stronger."
            
            "Where does your grandmother live, Little Red Riding Hood?"
            
            "A good quarter of a league farther on in the wood. Her house stands under the three large oak-trees, the nut-trees are just below. You surely must know it," replied Little Red Riding Hood.
            
            The wolf thought to himself, "What a tender young creature. What a nice plump mouthful, she will be better to eat than the old woman. I must act craftily, so as to catch both." So he walked for a short time by the side of Little Red Riding Hood, and then he said, "see Little Red Riding Hood, how pretty the flowers are about here. Why do you not look round. I believe, too, that you do not hear how sweetly the little birds are singing. You walk gravely along as if you were going to school, while everything else out here in the wood is merry."
            
            Little Red Riding Hood raised her eyes, and when she saw the sunbeams dancing here and there through the trees, and pretty flowers growing everywhere, she thought, suppose I take grandmother a fresh nosegay. That would please her too. It is so early in the day that I shall still get there in good time. And so she ran from the path into the wood to look for flowers. And whenever she had picked one, she fancied that she saw a still prettier one farther on, and ran after it, and so got deeper and deeper into the wood.
            
            Meanwhile the wolf ran straight to the grandmother's house and knocked at the door.
            
            "Who is there?"
            
            "Little Red Riding Hood," replied the wolf. "She is bringing cake and wine. Open the door."
            
            "Lift the latch," called out the grandmother, "I am too weak, and cannot get up."</p>
